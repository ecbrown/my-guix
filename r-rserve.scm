    (description
     "Rserve acts as a socket server (TCP/IP or local sockets) which
allows binary requests to be sent to R. Every connection has a
separate workspace and working directory. Client-side implementations
are available for popular languages such as C/C++ and Java, allowing
any application to use facilities of R without the need of linking to
R code. Rserve supports remote connection, user authentication and
file transfer. A simple R client is included in this package as
well.")
