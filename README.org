Here are a few of my favorite packages for Guix, that are either in development,
or have not yet met the quality requirements of Guix upstream.


The following work well enough on my system:

- Emacs Pastebin (emacs-pastebin)
- Spacemacs Theme (emacs-spacemacs-theme)
- Sunrise Commander (emacs-sunrise-commander)
- Sylpheed
- Sysbench

The following are broken for various reasons:
- Geary (can't find folks)
- Nextcloud (Segmentation Fault at Launch Time)
